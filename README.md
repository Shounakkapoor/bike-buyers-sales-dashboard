   - **Average Income Per Purchase**

     _Objective:_ See how income varies between those who purchase bikes and those who donâ€™t.  
   - **Customer Commute**  
     Line chart showing counts of buyers vs. non-buyers by commute distance.  
     _Objective:_ Understand whether shorter or longer commutes correlate with bike purchases.  
   - **Customer Age Bracket**  
     Line chart showing counts of buyers vs. non-buyers across age groups.  
     _Objective:_ Identify which age brackets are most likely to buy a bike.

2. **Bikes Sales Dashboard**  
   Interactive dashboard that brings together the three charts above, with slicers for Marital Status, Region, Education.  
   _Objective:_ Allow real-time filtering to explore how different demographics affect bike-buying behavior.
